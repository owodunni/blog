          This blog is a learning experience. For the longest time I have been
          meaning to improve my writing. By focusing on quantity and not quality
          I hope to become a better writier.

          When improving a skill most of the gain comes from the first 80% of
          progress, while most of the time goes into the last 20% percent. This
          blog is a homage to those first 80%.

        <p className="text-body-light">
          I plan to improve this website one hastily writen blog post at a time.
          And hopefully I might just become a better writer in the process.
